# Currency Converter API - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a Currency Converter API endpoint that enables currency conversion using Treasury reporting exchange rates.

## 2. Objectives

* Provide a RESTful API endpoint for currency conversion
* Support USD-based currency conversions using official exchange rate data
* Implement a lightweight, efficient conversion service

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 API Endpoint

* **Endpoint Name:** `/convert`
* **HTTP Method:** GET
* **Input Parameters** (URL query parameters):
    * `amount` (number): The monetary value to convert
    * `from` (string): Source currency ISO code (e.g., "USD", "EUR")
    * `to` (string): Target currency ISO code (e.g., "CAD", "JPY")

### 3.2 Data Source

* Exchange rate data will be sourced from a CSV file located in the `data` folder
* CSV contains exchange rates mapping USD to various currencies with their ISO codes
* Data source: https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/

### 3.3 Conversion Logic

* **Direct Conversion Only:** The system supports conversions where USD is either the source or target currency
* **Supported Conversion Patterns:**
    * USD -> Target Currency (e.g., USD to EUR)
    * Target Currency -> USD (e.g., EUR to USD)
* **Not Supported:** Transitive conversions between non-USD currencies (e.g., CAD to EUR)
* **Rationale:** The dataset only provides exchange rates from USD to other currencies

### 3.4 Implementation

* TypeScript function to handle conversion logic
* Parse CSV data to retrieve exchange rates
* Validate that at least one currency in the conversion pair is USD
* Calculate and return the converted amount

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* Clean, maintainable TypeScript code
* Proper error handling for invalid currency codes or unsupported conversions
* Efficient CSV parsing and lookup

## 5. Out of Scope

* Transitive currency conversions (non-USD pairs)
* Historical exchange rate lookups
* Real-time exchange rate updates

## 6. Future Considerations

* Support for transitive currency conversions between non-USD pairs
* Multiple data source integration
* Caching mechanism for exchange rates
