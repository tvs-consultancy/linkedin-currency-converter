## Technologies

- **TypeScript** — primary language
- **Cloudflare Workers** — production runtime
- **Wrangler CLI** — local development and deployment to Cloudflare

## Development Process

1. Before implementing, use DeepWiki's `ask_question` tool to get the latest information on relevant libraries so that code follows the most up-to-date APIs and patterns.
